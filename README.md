# Sliterlink
this project is based on a game called Slitherlink and was developed in Python by my colleague Andrea De Pellegrin and I as a university project. We have created all the functions and as regards the graphic aspetct, which was also develepped by us, we are been helped by a free library called "g2d" that was created by our Professor. We hope that you will enjoy our project
